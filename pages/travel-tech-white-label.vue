      <h5 class="font-weight-b600">How It Works!</h5>
      <li>
       We build a web page with your logo and branding, connect it to our vast inventory products, and empower it with our proprietary booking engine.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your White Label site’s header and footer will have the same design as your own main website, but it will be connected to our robust inventory and booking engine.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your job is simple, just integrate the White Label into your website, and let us take care of everything from reservation, confirmations to payment processing. No coding or fancy development required.
      </li>
      <li>
       When a booking is made via your website, our team will handle the online reservation with the same care that we use for bookings made directly with us.
      </li>
      <li>
       After our supply conffirms a booking, your client will receive a confirmation voucher with your logo on it via email. They will also receive contact information for both the suppliers and Tweet World Travel to ensure that they are
       supported before, during, and after their trip.
      </li>
      <li>
       Commission is calculated as a percentage of total booking value. Tweet World Travel pay your commission once customer has departed (to avoid cancellation to occur).
